            <p><strong>Data Driven Documents</strong> - Sounds boring, looks cool! You&#39;ve probably seen it
used already - maybe on the
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/04/29/upshot/money-race-and-success-how-your-school-district-compares.html"><strong>NYTimes</strong></a>
or on the creator <a href="https://bost.ocks.org/mike/algorithms/"><strong>Mike Bostock&#39;s</strong></a> site. This <a href="http://www.koalastothemax.com/"><strong>koala thing</strong></a> was made with D3
too. Come learn how you can use it to visualize your data! This
mob-programming session will be led by Justin Clark, a developer at the
Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society. It&#39;ll help to know a little javascript,
but all levels and experience are welcome. Bring your laptops to follow along.</p>
<p><strong>What is Mob Programming?</strong>
Mob programming is a software development approach where the whole team works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and at the same computer. With Mob Programming the collaboration is extended to everyone on the team, while still using a single computer for writing the code and inputting it into the code base. It&#39;s a great way to learn a new skill in a fun, low-pressure environment!</p>

            <p>Try mob-programming in R with South Side Civic! Want to learn R? Get
better? Hack on a cool civic project? Come join us for mob programming.
One computer, one keyboard, one project: mob rule. The session will be
facilitated by expert R evangelist Nick Mader.</p>
<p><strong>Nicholas Mader</strong> is a Senior Researcher at Chapin Hall at the University
of Chicago. His work focuses on improving outcomes for at-risk youth by
guiding policy development and evaluating youth service programs in
partnership with city agencies and non-profit providers. His
methodological interests are in using rigorous quantitative methods
applied to administrative data sets—the same data used by policy
makers—that are augmented with data from other agencies, and data
actively collected for applied questions. At Chapin Hall, this work
focuses on merging student educational performance with out-of-school
factors such as family instability, family poverty, criminal activity of
friends or family, and exposure to violence, child abuse or neglect.</p>

            <p>&#34;How does CPS&#39;s budget crisis affect my school?&#34;</p>
<p>Each summer, Chicago Public Schools (CPS) comes up with next-year’s budget for each school, but this year is different. With ballooning pension obligations, the country’s fourth largest school district is in crisis.</p>
<p>To help parents and students dissect the budget crisis and know what the specific impacts would be on his/her school, Lingwei Cheng and Patricia Gomes from the Northwestern University Knight Lab built Your CPS, a data-driven dynamic article that delivers personalized and interactive content about every CPS school.</p>

            <p>&#34;From Civic Hacking to Social Impact: Lessons from small successes and big failures in seeking social change through data and technology.&#34;</p>
<p>Matt is a Senior Researcher at the Center for Data Science and Public Policy as well as the Urban Center for Computation and Data at the University of Chicago. He cofounded and organizes the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Data Science for Social Good fellowship, and is a founding partner at the Impact Lab. He has served as an advisor to the World Bank, DataKind, and Code for America. In his research and practice he works to find novel applications of data science to public policy challenges that will improve human welfare. He loves UChicago and civic hacking, so he can’t think of a more enjoyable way to spend a Friday evening than to hang out with the folks at South Side Civic.</p>
