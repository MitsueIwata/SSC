					<p> Use Data. Solve Problems. Do good. </p>
					<p> South Side Civic was created to become a bridge between
						South Side nonprofits, small public offices, and social entrepreneurs
						and the UChicago network to help them use data and technology
						to solve challenges and advance their missions. </p>
					<p>The main objectives of the ScopeAthon are to form
						cross-functional teams to scope out problems faced by
						civic organizations, break the problems down into
						manageable parts and develop a plan to address them.
						The solutions may or may not be entirely tech-oriented,
						or only parts of the solution may have a tech component.</p>
					<br>
					<p>We are a<a href="https://capp.uchicago.edu/"

						student-led organization interested in policy,
						civic leadership, and tech innovation.
