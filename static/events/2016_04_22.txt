Markdown with Christine Chung|Friday, April 22, 2016|

**Make your life easier and reports prettier with South Side Civic!**

On Friday, April 22, we'll learn how to publish slick and simple reports (like [this][1],  [this][2], or [this][3]!) with chart and equation integration using Markdown and LaTeX. After a quick introduction to markup languages, we'll play with a few different tools like RMarkdown and Madoko. Bring your laptop and something you'd like to work on. It'll help to know a little R or Python, but all levels and experience are welcome!
