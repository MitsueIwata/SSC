UChicago Civic Hackathon|Friday, October 9, 2015|
"Keynote speaker - Aneesh Chopra"

Our civic hackathon may more appropriately be called a scope-athon. The main objective is to take a civic-minded or community-based problem and to form committed groups to scope out the problem, breaking it down into its parts and developing a plan to address the problem. The solutions may or may not be entirely tech-oriented, or only parts of the solution may have a tech component. |
