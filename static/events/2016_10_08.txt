**What is a Civic ScopeAthon?**
Our Civic ScopeAthon's main objective is to focus on a civic-minded or community-based problem, form cross-functional teams to scope out the problem, break the problem down into its parts and develop a plan to address the problem. The solutions may or may not be entirely tech-oriented, or only parts of the solution may have a tech component.

**What orgs are participating?**
We're excited to announce the participation of:

Forest Preserves of Cook County

Haitian Museum

Illinois Dept of Health and Human Services

Marriott Foundation

True Believers Community Connections
