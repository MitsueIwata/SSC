Mob Programming in R with Nick Mader|Friday, February 19, 2016|
Try mob-programming in R with South Side Civic! Want to learn R? Get
better? Hack on a cool civic project? Come join us for mob programming.
One computer, one keyboard, one project: mob rule. The session will be
facilitated by expert R evangelist Nick Mader.

**Nicholas Mader** is a Senior Researcher at Chapin Hall at the University
of Chicago. His work focuses on improving outcomes for at-risk youth by
guiding policy development and evaluating youth service programs in
partnership with city agencies and non-profit providers. His
methodological interests are in using rigorous quantitative methods
applied to administrative data sets—the same data used by policy
makers—that are augmented with data from other agencies, and data
actively collected for applied questions. At Chapin Hall, this work
focuses on merging student educational performance with out-of-school
factors such as family instability, family poverty, criminal activity of
friends or family, and exposure to violence, child abuse or neglect.
