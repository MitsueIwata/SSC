"From Civic Hacking to Social Impact: Lessons from small successes and big failures in seeking social change through data and technology."

Matt is a Senior Researcher at the Center for Data Science and Public Policy as well as the Urban Center for Computation and Data at the University of Chicago. He cofounded and organizes the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Data Science for Social Good fellowship, and is a founding partner at the Impact Lab. He has served as an advisor to the World Bank, DataKind, and Code for America. In his research and practice he works to find novel applications of data science to public policy challenges that will improve human welfare. He loves UChicago and civic hacking, so he canâ€™t think of a more enjoyable way to spend a Friday evening than to hang out with the folks at South Side Civic.|
